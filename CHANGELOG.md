# Riley — Deploy & Change Log

**Shared coordination log for parallel Claude Code sessions.** Multiple sessions deploy to
`main` at any given time. Before you start: `git fetch && git log --oneline -5` + read the top of
this file. After you ship to production: **append an entry here (newest first) in the same commit
or the next one, then push.** This is how each session knows what the others already changed.

Format per entry: `date` · `commit` — one-line summary · then bullets of what/why + files touched.
Keep it benign — this file is committed to a public-served repo, so **never put secrets here**.

### `7e132fa` — Programs page: split add-ons into Self-Guided vs Riley-Led
- **Why:** the client `/programs` "Program Add-ons" grid mixed self-guided content programs
  ($8.14, no Riley) with Riley-led coaching programs ($18.14, Session Zero + 14 sessions) in one
  undifferentiated list — members found it confusing.
- **What:** `programs.html` now renders two labeled sections, each with a serif header, a one-line
  descriptor, and a price pill: **Self-Guided Programs** (from $8.14) and **Riley-Led Programs**
  ($18.14). Split is driven by program `kind`: `self_guided`+`bundle` → self-guided; `interactive`+
  `guided` → Riley-led (`pgFamily()`/`pgSection()`). New programs slot in automatically.
- **Files:** `programs.html` only (CSS `.pg-fam*`, `#pg-avail`→`#pg-addons`, `loadPrograms()`).

### `7b6348c` — Client portal: remove redundant topbar ← Home / Ask Riley buttons
- **Why:** every client page has the left sidebar (Today = home) + the global floating Riley pill,
  so the top-right `← Home`/`← Tracker` + `Ask Riley` button pair was pure duplication.
- **What:** removed that button pair from **12 pages** (brief, calendar, conversations, finance,
  library, nutrition, programs, progress, sleep, tracker, workouts, chat).
- **Kept (do NOT remove):** the `+ New Chat` / `New Conversation` buttons (functional), the
  dashboard notification bell, the `← Back to dashboard` link on the **sidebar-less** pages
  (`program.html`/`profile.html`/`settings.html` — their only nav), and the `← Back to Home` links
  that live **inside the full-screen `🔒 feature-locked` overlays** (they're the escape hatch, not
  footer clutter — removing them traps users).

### `f6dbc6a` — Operator dashboard rework + Finance system
- Operator `operator.html`: top nav → **left sidebar** + Riley logo; tabs reorganized (PostHog
  Analytics nested under Social; Engagement→**Client Overview** w/ Safety merged; Metrics→**Riley
  Overview**; Add User → modal). New finance: **Revenue** (MRR from `subscriptions`) + editable
  **`operating_expenses`** table + Net, via `admin-finance.js` + migration `066`. Home shows an
  MRR·Expenses·Net snapshot. (Full detail in Claude memory: `operator-finance-rework-2026-07`.)
